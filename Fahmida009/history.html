    <p>
      The Islamic University of Technology (IUT) was established in 1978 in Dhaka, Bangladesh as a subsidiary organ of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The vision was to promote higher education, technical expertise, and innovation across the Islamic world.

      IUT began as the Islamic Center for Technical and Vocational Training and Research (ICTVTR). Its transformation into a university came in 2001, reflecting its evolving academic and research excellence. IUT is the only international university fully funded by OIC member states and is dedicated to serving students from all 57 member countries.
